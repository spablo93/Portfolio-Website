						<h3>What is Linear Algebra?</h3>
						<p>
						"Nearly every problem in linear algebra can be reduced to a system
						of linear equations..."
						</p>

						<p>
						Linear algebra is the study of systems of linear equations and
						their corresponding solutions. Systems of linear equations have a
						multitude of applications in engineering, applied science, and
						mathematics. We will learn to approach these systems from
						different viewpoints, both algebraically and geometrically, to
						help us better understand what they represent. Before getting too
						deep into the main ideas of linear algebra, we will focus on three
						basic things:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>What is a linear equation?</li>
							<li>Why do we call it <em>linear</em> ?</li>
							<li>
								What is a solution to a system of linear equations, and how do
								we find said solution?
							</li>
						</ul>

						<div class="definition_container">
							<div class="definition">
								<div class="definition_header">
									<p><em>linear equation</em></p>
								</div>
								<div class="definition_text">
									<p>
									A <em style="color: blue">linear equation</em> in variables
									$x_1$, $x_2$, ..., $x_n$ is any equation of the form
									$$\begin{equation}\tag{1.1}\label{eq:lineq}
									a_1x_1+a_2x_2+\cdots +a_nx_n=b, \end{equation}$$ where
									$a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$, and $b$ are constant real numbers.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
						</div>
						<p>
						A few comments on notation before we move forward: In the above
						equation, we can think of the subscript $i$ on the variable $x_i$
						as a label to tell the difference between each variables. For
						example, we may have $3$ variables, $x_1, x_2, x_3$, and we use
						the subscript to tell the difference between them. Alternatively,
						we could just use the labels $x, y, z$ for three variables (at the
						end of the day, the labeling of the variables isn't that
						important, so long as we are consistent with our labeling!).
						</p>
						<p>
						Also the notation $x_1$, $x_2$, ..., $x_n$ and
						$a_1x_1+a_2x_2+\cdots +a_nx_n$ used above is just a general way to
						write an expression that follows some pattern with $n$ variables,
						where $n$ is a positive whole number. If we choose $n=5$, then we
						have variables $x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$, $x_4$, $x_5$ and then equation
						(\ref{eq:lineq}) would have the form
						$a_1x_1+a_2x_2+a_3x_3+a_4x_4+a_5x_5=b$.
						</p>
						<p>
						Lastly, when we say that $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$, and $b$ are
						<em>constant</em> real numbers, we mean that they are fixed and in
						practice do not change value, while the variables $x_1$, $x_2$,
						..., $x_n$ could possibly take multiple values.
						</p>

							a linear equation in two variables $x$ and $y$: $3x+2y=4$.

							<h4>Why is it called a <em>linear</em> equation?</h4>
							<p>
							Consider a familiar equation in variables $x$ and $y$: $y=ax+b$.
							We call this "linear" because its graph represents a straight
							line, and the reason for this is because both variables appear
							only in the first degree in the equation. To generalize this
							idea to equations with more than two variables: in any linear
							equation, we want all variables to appear only in the first
							degree.
							</p>
							<p>
							There are two <em>linear operations</em> that we can perform on
							our variables in linear algebra
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>addition</li>
								<li>scalar multiplication</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
							On the left-hand side of (\ref{eq:lineq}), we see that we have
							only scaled our variables by constant numbers, and summed the
							resulting quantities. We are <em>not</em> allowed to:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									multiply variables - no expressions like $x_1x_2$ or
									$x_2x_4x_n$ appear in the equation.
								</li>
								<li>
									take powers of our variables - no expressions like $x_1^3$ or
									$\sqrt{x_n}$ appear in the equation.
								</li>
								<li>
									take our variables as inputs of complicated functions - no
									expressions like $\ln(x_1)$, $e^{x_2}$ or $\cos(x_n)$ appear
									in the equation.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
							So our linear operations ensure that we only obtain expressions
							of our variables in the first degree.
							</p>
							<p>
							The equation form given in (\ref{eq:lineq}) is the
							<em>standard form</em> of a linear equation, and the only
							requirement for the right-hand side of the equation is that it
							is any constant number. An equation is linear if it is
							equivalent to an equation of the form (\ref{eq:lineq}).

								<b>Basic application of linear systems: Music festival
									booking</b>
								<p>
								A music festival has $3$ stages: one for pop/hip-hop, one for
								indie/alternative, and one for house/techno. The festival has
								a booking budget of \$$1.8$ million and the average cost per
								act booked is given by
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>\$$96,000$ per pop/hip-hop act,</li>
									<li>\$$72,000$ per indie/alternative act,</li>
									<li>\$$54,000$ per house/techno act.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
								Furthermore, the expected ticket sales per act booked is given
								by
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>$6,000$ per pop/hip-hop act,</li>
									<li>$2,000$ per indie/alternative act,</li>
									<li>$4,000$ per house/techno act.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
								Suppose the festival wants to book $24$ acts total, use their
								full budget, and expect to sell $100,000$ tickets. How can we
								set up a system whose solution represents the number of each
								type of act to book?
								</p>
								<p>
								<em>Solution:</em> We introduce variables $x$, $y$, and $z$
								representing number of pop/hip-hop acts, indie/alternative
								acts, and house/techno acts to be booked, respectively.
								</p>
								<p>Since we want to book $24$ acts total, then we have</p>
								$$x+y+z=24.$$
								<p>
								Next, since we want to use the full booking budget of $\$1.8$
								million and we know the cost of booking each act in thousands
								of dollars, then we have
								</p>
								$$96x+72y+54z=1800.$$
								<p>
								Lastly, since we want to sell 100,000 tickets and we know the
								expected ticket sales per type of act booked in thousands of
								sales, we have
								</p>

								$$6x+2y+4z=100.$$
								<p>
								So the following system will have the desired solution $x$,
								$y$, and $z$:
								</p>

								\begin{align*} x+y+z & =24 \\ 96x+72y+54z & =1800 \\ 6x+2y+4z &
								=100 \end{align*} One can verify that $x=9$, $y=7$, $z=8$ is the
								unique solution to the above system. But how can we determine
								this solution, given the above system that we constructed?

						<h3>Solving Linear Systems</h3>
						<section class="main-subsubsection">
							<h4>Matrix Systems</h4>
							<p>
							In high school algebra, you (should have) learned how to solve a
							system of, say, two equations in two variables via elimination.
							i.e. we multiply our equations by constants to get one variable
							to have the same coefficient in both equations, so that we can
							eliminate said variable, and isolate the other variable. For
							example, if we wanted to solve the system given in
							<b>Example 1.1.3</b>:
							</p>
							\begin{align*} 3x+2y & =4 \\ -4x-3y & =-1 \end{align*}
							<p>
							we could multiply equation 1 by $3$ and equation 2 by $2$, and
							obtain
							</p>
							\begin{align*} 9x+6y & =12 \\ -8x-6y & =-2 \end{align*}
							<p>
							Then adding these two equations together gives
							$9x-8x+6y-6y=12-2$, which eliminates $y$ and isolates $x$, and
							we obtain $x=10$. Then substituting $x=10$ back into any of our
							original equations allows us to solve for $y$. Performing this
							on equation 1 gives $$3\cdot10+2y=4,$$ then solving for $y$
							gives $y=-13$.
							</p>
							<p>
							Now, doing this is easy when we have a small system like this,
							but as we increase the number of variables or number of
							equations, this algorithm can get quite messy. Even solving a
							system of three equations in three variables in this way can be
							a headache.
							</p>
							<p>
							Thankfully, we have a relatively straightforward algorithm that
							allows us to solve larger systems in a cleaner way. But first,
							we need to introduce additional notation and terminology:

									<div class="definition_text">
										<p>
										The system of linear equations given in
										<b>Definition 1.1.2</b> has the corresponding
										<em style="color: blue">augmented matrix system</em>
										$$\left[\begin{array}{cccc|c}
										a_{11}&a_{12}&\cdots&a_{1n}&b_1\\
										a_{21}&a_{22}&\cdots&a_{2n}&b_2\\
										\vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots&\vdots\\
										a_{m1}&a_{m2}&\cdots&a_{mn}&b_m \end{array}\right].$$ We
										call the matrix of coefficients $a_{ij}$ $$\begin{bmatrix}

										a_{21}&a_{22}&\cdots&a_{2n}\\
										\vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ a_{m1}&a_{m2}&\cdots&a_{mn}

							<p>
							In the previous coefficient matrix, note that the $i$th row
							$\begin{bmatrix} a_{i1}&a_{i2}&\cdots&a_{in}\\ \end{bmatrix}$
							corresponds to the coefficients of $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_n$
							respectively, in the $i$th equation of the system. On the other
							hand, the $j$th column $\begin{bmatrix}
							a_{1j}\\a_{2j}\\\vdots\\a_{m_j} \end{bmatrix}$ corresponds to
							the coefficients of variable $x_j$ in each equation of the
							system. Viewing a linear system as an augmented matrix
							simplifies notation significantly when solving for a solution.
							We also see that all that we need to maintain the structure of
							the system is the arrangement of constant coefficients terms.

							<h4>Elementary Row Operations</h4>

							<p>
							We want to develop an algorithm to solve for a solution to this

							hand via elimination, while relying on the rigid structure that
							a matrix maintains. We introduce the following row operations

							<p>
							If we observe how performing these operations change the

							<h4>Gauss-Jordan Elimination (Row Reduction)</h4>

								<ol>
									<li>
										We first want to obtain a $1$ in the top-left corner of the
										augmented system (if possible) by performing any elementary
										row operations. We call this $1$ a <em>leading one</em> (or
										more generally, a <em>leading entry</em>), because it is the
										first non-zero entry in its row. We see that performing the
										operation $R_1\leftrightarrow R_2$ to the system gives a
										leading one in the first row: \begin{equation}\tag{1.3}
										\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 & 1 & 1 & 4 \\ 4 & -1 & 1 & 13
										\\ 2 & 0 & 2 & 2 \end{array}\right] \end{equation}
									</li>
									<li>
										Next, we want to obtain a $0$ in every row below the leading
										one, by adding scalar multiples of row 1 to the succeeding
										rows. Performing the operations $R_2-4R_1\to R_2$ and
										$R_3-2R_1\to R_3$ "clears below" the first leading one:
										\begin{equation}\tag{1.4} \left[\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 & 1 &
										1 & 4 \\ 0 & -5 & -3 & -3 \\ 0 & -2 & 0 & -6
										\end{array}\right] \end{equation}
									</li>
									<li>
										We are done with the first row and first column for now, and
										we want to obtain a leading one in the second row second
										column entry (if possible). Performing the row operation
										$R_2-3R_3\to R_2$ gives the desired leading one:
										\begin{equation}\tag{1.5} \left[\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 & 1 &
										1 & 4 \\ 0 & 1 & -3 & 15 \\ 0 & -2 & 0 & -6
										\end{array}\right] \end{equation}
									</li>
									<li>
										We next continue in a similar manner, and clear below the
										second leading one to obtain $0$'s below it. Performing the
										operation $R_3+2R_2\to R_3$ gives: \begin{equation}\tag{1.6}
										\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 & 1 & 1 & 4 \\ 0 & 1 & -3 & 15
										\\ 0 & 0 & -6 & 24 \end{array}\right] \end{equation} Our
										matrix is now in <em>row-echelon form</em> (which we will
										define momentarily), but we continue to reduce the system to
										<em>reduced row-echelon form</em>, because it will make it
										easier to determine our solution.
									</li>
									<li>
										We obtain our last leading one in the third row third column
										entry by performing $-\tfrac{1}{6}R_3\to R_3$:
										\begin{equation}\tag{1.7} \left[\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 & 1 &
										1 & 4 \\ 0 & 1 & -3 & 15 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -4
										\end{array}\right] \end{equation}
									</li>
									<li>
										Now, to obtain the reduced-row-echelon form of the system,
										we simply want to clear above each leading one, but this
										time moving right-to-left across the columns of the
										coefficient matrix. Performing $R_2+3R_3\to R_2$ and
										$R_1-R_3\to R_1$, we obtain \begin{equation}\tag{1.8}
										\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 & 1 & 0 & 8 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 3 \\
										0 & 0 & 1 & -4 \end{array}\right] \end{equation}
									</li>
									<li>
										Lastly, performing $R_1-R_2\to R_1$, we obtain the reduced
										row-echelon form of the system: \begin{equation}\tag{1.9}
										\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 & 0 & 0 & 5 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 3 \\
										0 & 0 & 1 & -4 \end{array}\right] \end{equation}
									</li>
								</ol>
								<p>
								Now, this reduced augmented system translates as the following
								linear system:
								</p>
								$$\begin{array}{rrrl} 1x & +0y&+0z&=5\\ 0x &+1y&+0z&=3\\ 0x
								&+0y&+1z&=-4 \end{array}$$
								<p>So we see that</p>
								$$\begin{bmatrix} x\\y\\z \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} 5\\3\\-4
								\end{bmatrix},$$
								<p>
								is the (unique) solution to our system. We can verify by
								checking that this solution satisfies our original three
								equations:
								</p>
								$$\begin{array}{rrrlrrl} 4x & -y&+z&=4(5)&-3&+(-4)&=13\\ x &+y
								&+z&=5&+3&+(-4)&=4\\ 2x & &+2z&=2(5)& &+2(-4)&=2 \end{array}.$$

								We saw that the $\mathrm{RREF}$ immediately gave the unique

								\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} 5\\3\\-4 \end{bmatrix}$, but the
								$\mathrm{REF}$ is enough to find the solution via

								</p>

								$$\begin{array}{rrrl} x & +y&+z&=4\\ &y& -3z&=15\\ & &-6z&=24

								<p>
								We can solve the equations in reverse order, since the third

								<p>
								The third equation gives $z=-4$. Then we see that in the

								$$y=15+3z=15+3(-4)=3.$$

								<p>
								So the row-echelon form is the minimum form to easily find the

							Now, we see that the corresponding system does not immediately

							\begin{equation} \begin{array}{rrrrl} x_1 & -2x_2 & & +2x_4 & =14
							\\ & & x_3 & -3x_4 & =-8 \end{array} \end{equation}
							<p>
							How can we describe our solution as a vector of numbers? We will
							formalize the process of describing our solution in the
							following way:
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>
									The variables which correspond to columns with leading ones
									are called <em>determined variables</em> (<em>basic variables</em>). That is, $x_1$ and $x_3$ are
									determined variables. We call
									them determined variables because we will be determining these
									variables explicitly in our solution.
								</li>
								<li>
									The variables which do not correspond to columns with leading
									ones are called <em>free variables</em>. That is, $x_2$ and
									$x_4$ are free variables. We call them free variables, because
									we are free to choose them to be any real number.
								</li>
								<li>
									In the equations from our reduced system, solve for the
									determined variables in terms of the free variables.
								</li>
							</ol>
							<p>Solving for $x_1$ in equation (1) and $x_3$ in equation (2) we obtain</p>
							\begin{align*}
							x_1 & =14+2x_2-2x_4 \\
							x_3 & =-8+3x_4
							\end{align*}
							<p>Then since $x_2$ and $x_4$ are free variables, we are free to choose them to be any number, so we can
							just label these variables as themselves. Then we can represent any solution to the system in the explicit
							form:</p>
							$$\begin{bmatrix}
							x_1\\x_2\\x_3\\x_4
							\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}
							14+2x_2-2x_4\\
							x_2\\
							-8+3x_4\\
							x_4
							\end{bmatrix},$$
							<p>where $x_2$ and $x_4$ can be any real number.</p>
							<p>Since the system has two free variables, we see that we have infinitely many solutions. For example,
							choosing $x_2=0$ and $x_4=0$ or instead choosing $x_2=1$ and $x_4=-1$ gives two particular solutions to
							the system</p>
							$$\begin{bmatrix}
							x_1\\x_2\\x_3\\x_4
							\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}
							14\\
							0\\
							-8\\
							0
							\end{bmatrix}, \quad \begin{bmatrix}
							x_1\\x_2\\x_3\\x_4
							\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}
							18\\
							1\\
							-11\\
							-1
							\end{bmatrix}.$$
							<p>When we have infinitely many solutions to a system it is often useful to describe all solutions by a
							<em>solution set</em>. A <em>set</em> of mathematical objects as simply a
							collection of objects. We can describe the solution set $S$ to the system in the following way:
							</p>
							$$S=\left\{\begin{bmatrix}
							14+2x_2-2x_4\\
							x_2\\
							-8+3x_4\\
							x_4
							\end{bmatrix}\ \Bigg|\ x_2, x_4\in\mathbb{R}
							\right\}.$$
							<p>The set notation above can be read in the following way: "$S$ is the set of all vectors
							of the form $\begin{bmatrix}
							14+2x_2-2x_4\\
							x_2\\
							-8+3x_4\\
							x_4
							\end{bmatrix}$ such that $x_2$ and $x_4$ are real numbers".</p>
							<p>Typically, the item on the left-hand side of the middle bar gives a basic description for the elements of
							the set (i.e. all elements in the solution set are vectors of the described form). Then the descriptions
							on the right-hand side of the bar give additional requirements for the elements of the set (i.e. the only
							requirement of these vectors is that our choice of $x_2$ and $x_4$ are real numbers).</p>
							<p>
							<h5>Parameterizing solution variables</h5>
							</p>
							<p>For notational and aesthetic (and possibly functional) purposes, a common practice is to
							<em>parameterize</em> the free variables in a system, which essentially means to
							"relabel" the free variables. In the previous example, we only have two
							free variables, namely, $x_2$ and $x_4$, but maybe it doesn't make sense to have these labels, as they
							appear a bit arbitrary in the final solution.
							</p>
							<p>
							A common practice is to relabel the free variables as new variables <em>parameters</em>. We often use
							variables such as $r,s,t$ to do this. So in the previous example, by letting $x_2=r$ and $x_4=s$, where
							$r$ and $s$ are assumed to be any real numbers, the solution to the system is given by all vectors of the
							form
							</p>
							$$\begin{bmatrix}
							x_1\\x_2\\x_3\\x_4
							\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}
							14+2r-2s\\
							r\\
							-8+3s\\
							s
							\end{bmatrix}.$$

							solutions, but how do we know if a system has no solution?</p>
							<p>Consider the following linear system with corresponding matrix system</p>
              <div class="numbered_equation_container">
                <div class="equation">
                <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-12"></div>
                <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-12">
                  \begin{equation}\tag{}
							\begin{array}{rrrrl}
							x_1 & -4x_2 & -2x_3 & =3 \\
							-x_1 & +x_2 & -x_3 & =1 \\
							3x_1 & -3x_2 & +3x_3 & =2
							\end{array}\end{equation}
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-12">
                  \begin{equation}\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
							1 & -4& -2&3\\
							-1 & 1& -1&1\\
							3 & -3 & 3&2
							\end{array}\right]
							\end{equation}
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-12"></div>
              </div>
                </div>
              </div>
              
							<p>After applying the following row operations in order to the augmented matrix $R_2+R_1\to R_2$,
							$R_3-3R_1\to R_3$, $R_3+3R_2\to R_3$, we obtain the following row-echelon form of the system:</p>
							\begin{equation}
							\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}
							1 & -4 & -2 & 3 \\
							0 & -3 & -3 & 4 \\
							0 & 0 & 0 & 5
							\end{array}\right]
							\end{equation}
							<p>Now, in this reduced system the last equation reads as</p>
							$$0x_1+0x_2+0x_3=5,$$
							<p>so we would only have a solution to this system if $0=5$. But since $0\neq 5$, then it must be that we
							have no solution. So, when trying to reduce a system to find a solution, if we ever obtain a contradiction
							in our system, such as $0=c$, where $c\neq 0$, then we can immediately conclude that a system has no
							solution.</p>

									<div class="definition_header">

										</p>
									</div>
								</div>
							</div>
							<p>The results from the various systems that we have solved may have you asking the following question: if a
							system has more than one solution, must it have infinitely many? The following theorem answers that
							question:</p>
							<div class="theorem_container">
								<div class="theorem">
									<div class="theorem_header">
										<p><em>Number of solutions to a non-homogeneous linear system</em></p>
									</div>
									<div class="theorem_text">
										<p>
										Any non-homogeneous system of linear equations has either zero, one, or infinitely many solutions.
										There are no other possibilities.
										</p>
									</div>
								</div>
							</div>
							<p>The proof of this theorem will be provided once we have a better understanding of the structure of linear
							systems.</p>
							<p>Now, in the case of a homogeneous system, we have the following result:</p>
							<div class="theorem_container">
								<div class="theorem">
									<div class="theorem_header">
										<p><em>Number of solutions to a homogeneous linear system</em></p>
									</div>
									<div class="theorem_text">
										<p>
										Any homogeneous system of linear equations has either one or infinitely many solutions. There are no
										other possibilities.
										</p>
									</div>
								</div>
							</div>
							<p>To understand why this is true, try to think about why the <em>zero vector</em> $\vec{0}=\begin{bmatrix}
							0\\0\\\vdots\\0
							\end{bmatrix}$ is always a solution to any homogeneous system.</p>

							<h4>Geometric Interpretation of Solution Sets</h4>
							<p>Now we have a decent understanding of how to interpret our solutions algebraically as vectors, but what
							do these solutions (or lack of solutions) look like geometrically? To start, let's consider systems in two
							variables.</p>
							<b>System with no solution</b>
							<p>The following system</p>
							\begin{equation}
							\begin{array}{rrl}
							2x & -y & =1 \\
							-4x & +2y & =2
							\end{array}
							\end{equation}
							<p>has no solution. If $\begin{bmatrix}
							x\\y
							\end{bmatrix}$ was a solution, then we could interpret it as a point which lies on both the line
							represented by $2x-y=1$ and the line $-4x+2y=2$. However, we see that after solving for $y$ we obtain the
							lines $y=2x-1$ and $y=2x+1$. Then graphing these lines, gives</p>
							<img class="figure" style="max-width: 40%" src="./images/1-3_2Dnosolution.jpg" alt="">
							<p>So the two lines defined by the system are parallel (since they both have slope $\frac{1}{2}$) but not
							equal (since they have different $y$-intercepts). Therefore, the two lines will never intersect, and so
							there is no point which lies on both lines. Hence, the system has no solution.</p>
							<b>System with infinitely many solutions</b>
							<p>
							Now consider the following system:
							</p>
							\begin{equation}
							\begin{array}{rrl}
							3x & -3y & =6 \\
							-4x & +4y & =-8
							\end{array}
							\end{equation}
							<p>
							which has infinitely many solutions given by $\begin{bmatrix}
							x\\y
							\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}
							2+t\\t
							\end{bmatrix}$, $t\in\mathbb{R}$. Now, note that both equations in the system represent the line $y=x-2$:
							</p>
							<img class="figure" style="max-width: 40%" src="./images/1-3_2Dinfsolutions.jpg" alt="">
							<p>So the two lines represented by $3x-3y=6$ and $-4x+4y=-8$ are in fact the same line, and so they have
							infinitely many intersection points, and hence, the system has infinitely many solutions.</p>
							<b>System with one solution</b>
							<p>Lastly, consider the following system:</p>
							\begin{equation}
							\begin{array}{rrl}
							x & -2y & =-2 \\
							-2x & +y & =1
							\end{array}
							\end{equation}
							<p>which has a unique solution given by $\begin{bmatrix}
							x\\y
							\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}
							0\\1
							\end{bmatrix}$. Note that the lines represented by $x-2y=-2$ and $-2x+y=1$ are given explicitly by
							$y=\frac{1}{2}x+1$ and $y=2x+1$ respectively:</p>
							<img class="figure" style="max-width: 40%" src="./images/1-3_2Donesolution.jpg" alt="">
							<p>We see that the two lines determined by the system intersect at exactly one point, $\begin{bmatrix}
							0\\1
							\end{bmatrix}$ which is precisely our unique solution to the system.</p>
							<b>Geometric interpretation of Solution sets for systems in 3 variables</b>
							<p>When working with three variables, we can represent points in three-dimensional space corresponding to
							the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axis. We plot a point $\begin{bmatrix}x_0\\y_0\\z_0\end{bmatrix}$ in 3-space similar
							to how we plot a point $\begin{bmatrix}x_0\\y_0\end{bmatrix}$ on the plane—by
							moving the specified number of units along each axis:</p>
							<img class="figure" style="max-width: 40%" src="./images/1-3_3Dplot.jpg" alt="">
							<p>A linear equation in three variables represents a (flat) plane in 3D space.</p>
							<div class="example">
								<p>The $xy$-plane represents all points of the form $\begin{bmatrix}x\\y\\0\end{bmatrix}$, which have a
								$z$ coordinate of $0$.</p>
								<img class="figure" style="max-width: 40%" src="./images/1-3_3Dxyplane.jpg" alt="">
							</div>
							<p>A system in three variables with no solution is either one in which two (or more) of the equations
							represent parallel planes which never intersect, or one in which all of the planes in the system do not
							intersect at a singular point.</p>
							<img class="figure" style="max-width: 60%" src="./images/1-3_3Dnosolution.jpg" alt="">
							<p>In the latter example, we see that the the cyan and red planes intersect at violet line, the cyan and
							yellow planes intersect at the green line, and red and yellow planes intersect at the orange line. But the
							3 planes together never intersect in one place. We can additionally see this from the fact that the
							intersection of each pair of planes form 3 different vertical, parallel lines.</p>
							<p>The solution to a system in three variables with infinitely many solutions can either represent a single
							plane (two free variables) or a line in which two (or more) different planes intersect (one free
							variable):</p>
							<img class="figure" style="max-width: 60%" src="./images/1-3_3Dinfsolutions.jpg" alt="">
							<p>The solution to a system in three variables with one unique solution (no free variables) represents the
							unique point in which three (or more) different planes intersect.</p>
							<img class="figure" style="max-width: 40%" src="./images/1-3_3Donesolution.jpg" alt="">
							<p>Do not worry too much about being able to draw these geometric interpretations of a solution in three
							dimensions, but understand what these different types of solutions represent, and particularly how the
							number of free variables in a system tells us about the geometric interpretation of the solution.</p>
